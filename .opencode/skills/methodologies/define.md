# Define Methods

Methods for framing problems and defining opportunities.

## Problem Framing

**Purpose:** Transform observations into clear, actionable problem statements

**When to use:**
- After empathy research
- When problem is vague
- Before ideation
- To focus team effort

**How to frame:**

1. **Start with observations:**
   - What did you see/hear?
   - What patterns emerged?
   - What surprised you?

2. **Identify the real problem:**
   - What's the underlying issue?
   - Who experiences this?
   - Why does it matter?
   - What would success look like?

3. **Make it specific:**
   - ❌ Bad: "Users are unhappy"
   - ✅ Good: "New merchants abandon onboarding at step 3 (product creation) because they don't understand required fields"

**Template:**
```
[User type] experiences [problem] when [context] because [root cause].
This matters because [impact].
```

**Example:**
```
Busy merchants experience frustration when creating their first product 
because the form asks for 15 fields without explaining which are required.
This matters because 40% abandon at this step, preventing platform growth.
```

## How Might We (HMW)

**Purpose:** Reframe problems as opportunity questions that inspire solutions

**When to use:**
- After defining problem
- Before brainstorming
- To open solution space
- To shift from problem to opportunity

**Format:**
```
How might we [action] for [user] so that [outcome]?
```

**Rules:**
- Start with "How might we..."
- Make it broad enough to allow creativity
- Make it narrow enough to be actionable
- Avoid suggesting solutions
- Focus on user benefit

**Examples:**

**From Problem to HMW:**

Problem: "Merchants abandon product creation form"

HMW Questions:
- How might we make product creation faster for busy merchants?
- How might we guide merchants through required fields?
- How might we reduce form complexity without losing data?
- How might we help merchants understand what's required?
- How might we save merchant progress so they can return later?

**Good vs Bad HMW:**

| Bad (too narrow) | Good (actionable) | Bad (too broad) |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| HMW add tooltips? | HMW guide merchants through fields? | HMW make everything better? |
| HMW reduce to 5 fields? | HMW reduce form complexity? | HMW improve UX? |

**Technique: Ladder Up/Down**

Start with HMW, then:
- **Ladder Up** (broader): "How might we make onboarding easier?"
- **Ladder Down** (narrower): "How might we explain the 'SKU' field?"

Choose the level that's most actionable.

## Point of View (POV) Statement

**Purpose:** Create user-centered problem statement that captures who, what, and why

**Format:**
```
[User type] needs [what] because [insight].
```

**Components:**
- **User:** Specific persona or segment
- **Need:** What they're trying to accomplish
- **Insight:** Surprising discovery from research

**How to create:**

1. **Identify user:** Be specific
   - ❌ "Users"
   - ✅ "First-time merchants with <10 products"

2. **Define need:** What they're trying to do
   - ❌ "Better UX"
   - ✅ "Create first product quickly without errors"

3. **Add insight:** Surprising "because"
   - ❌ "Because it's hard"
   - ✅ "Because they don't know e-commerce terminology"

**Examples:**

```
First-time merchants need to create their first product in under 5 minutes
because they're testing the platform and will abandon if it feels complex.
```

```
Busy store owners need to skip optional fields during setup
because they value speed over completeness and will fill details later.
```

```
Non-technical merchants need plain language labels
because they don't understand terms like "SKU", "variant", or "inventory policy".
```

**From POV to HMW:**

POV: "Merchants need plain language because they don't know e-commerce terms"

HMW: "How might we explain e-commerce concepts in plain language?"

## Jobs to be Done (JTBD)

**Purpose:** Identify the functional, emotional, and social jobs users are hiring your solution to do

**Format:**
```
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome].
```

**Job Types:**

1. **Functional Job:** What task needs doing?
   - "When I get a new product, I want to list it online, so I can start selling"

2. **Emotional Job:** How do they want to feel?
   - "When I set up my store, I want to feel confident, so I don't worry about mistakes"

3. **Social Job:** How do they want to be perceived?
   - "When I launch my store, I want to look professional, so customers trust me"

**How to discover JTBD:**

Ask:
- What job are they trying to do?
- What progress do they want to make?
- What are they really hiring this for?
- What alternatives do they use?
- What would make them switch?

**Example:**

```
Situation: New merchant setting up first product
Functional: I want to list product quickly so I can test the platform
Emotional: I want to feel confident so I don't worry about errors
Social: I want to look professional so customers trust my store
```

**JTBD vs Features:**

| Feature Thinking | JTBD Thinking |
|------------------|---------------|
| "Add product form" | "Help merchants get first product live fast" |
| "Tooltips" | "Make merchants feel confident they're doing it right" |
| "Templates" | "Help merchants look professional without design skills" |

**From JTBD to Solutions:**

Job: "When setting up my store, I want to feel confident, so I don't worry about mistakes"

Solutions:
- Progress indicator showing what's complete
- Validation that shows errors before submission
- Preview of how product will look
- Undo/edit after publishing

## Affinity Clustering

**Purpose:** Group related observations to reveal patterns and themes

**When to use:**
- After user interviews
- When you have many observations
- To find patterns
- Before defining problems

**How to do it:**

1. **Write observations on sticky notes:**
   - One observation per note
   - Use direct quotes when possible
   - Include context

2. **Group similar items:**
   - What connects these?
   - What theme emerges?
   - Don't overthink - trust intuition

3. **Name each cluster:**
   - What's the theme?
   - Use user language
   - Make it specific

4. **Look for insights:**
   - What patterns emerge?
   - What surprises you?
   - What's the story?

**Example:**

```
Raw Observations (from 8 merchant interviews):
- "I don't know what SKU means"
- "Too many fields, I just want to start"
- "I abandoned because it asked for shipping weight"
- "Why do I need a barcode?"
- "I don't have professional photos yet"
- "Can I come back and finish later?"
- "I'm not sure what's required"
- "The form feels overwhelming"

Clusters:

📦 Terminology Confusion (4 notes)
- "I don't know what SKU means"
- "Why do I need a barcode?"
- "I don't know what variant means"
- "What's inventory policy?"

⚡ Speed/Urgency (3 notes)
- "Too many fields, I just want to start"
- "Can I come back later?"
- "I just want to test the platform"

😰 Overwhelm (3 notes)
- "The form feels overwhelming"
- "I'm not sure what's required"
- "I don't have all this info yet"

🚫 Irrelevant Fields (2 notes)
- "I abandoned because it asked for shipping weight"
- "I don't have professional photos yet"

Insights:
1. Merchants don't understand e-commerce terminology
2. They want to start fast and fill details later
3. Form feels overwhelming (too many fields at once)
4. Some fields feel irrelevant for their situation
```

**From Clusters to POV:**

Cluster: "Terminology Confusion"

POV: "First-time merchants need plain language labels because they don't know e-commerce terminology"

## When to Use Each Method

| Method | Best For | Time | Output |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| **Problem Framing** | Making vague problems specific | 30 min | Clear problem statement |
| **How Might We** | Opening solution space | 15-30 min | Opportunity questions |
| **POV Statement** | User-centered framing | 15 min | User need + insight |
| **JTBD** | Understanding motivation | 30-60 min | Job statement |
| **Affinity Clustering** | Finding patterns in research | 1-2 hours | Themes, insights |

**Typical Workflow:**
```
Affinity Clustering → Problem Framing → POV Statement → HMW Questions → Ideation
```

---

## Tips

**Problem Framing:**
- Be specific (who, what, when, where, why)
- Use data (40% abandon, not "many")
- Focus on one problem at a time

**How Might We:**
- Generate 10+ HMW questions per problem
- Vary scope (ladder up/down)
- Avoid suggesting solutions
- Pick 1-3 to explore

**POV Statement:**
- Use real user quotes for insight
- Make it specific (not "users")
- Insight should surprise you

**JTBD:**
- Look beyond functional job
- Ask "What are they really hiring this for?"
- Consider emotional and social jobs

**Affinity Clustering:**
- Do it as a team (shared understanding)
- Don't force groupings
- Name clusters in user language
- Look for surprising patterns
