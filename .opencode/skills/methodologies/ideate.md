# Ideate Methods

Methods for generating creative solutions.

## Brainstorming

**Purpose:** Generate large quantity of diverse ideas without judgment

**When to use:**
- After defining problem (HMW)
- Need many options
- Team ideation
- Breaking mental blocks

**Rules:**

1. **Defer judgment** - No criticism during generation
2. **Go for quantity** - Aim for 50+ ideas
3. **Encourage wild ideas** - Crazy ideas spark breakthroughs
4. **Build on others** - "Yes, and..." not "Yes, but..."
5. **Stay focused** - Keep HMW question visible
6. **Be visual** - Sketch, don't just write

**How to run:**

1. **Setup (5 min):**
   - Write HMW question on board
   - Review rules
   - Set timer (15-30 min)

2. **Generate (15-30 min):**
   - Everyone writes ideas on sticky notes
   - One idea per note
   - Call out ideas to spark others
   - Build on what you hear

3. **Share (10 min):**
   - Post all ideas on wall
   - Quick read-through
   - No discussion yet

4. **Cluster (10 min):**
   - Group similar ideas
   - Name themes
   - Identify patterns

**Tips:**
- Warm up first (practice round)
- Set quantity goal (50 ideas)
- Use timer (creates urgency)
- Stand up (more energy)
- Play music (sets mood)

**Example:**

HMW: "How might we guide merchants through product creation?"

Ideas:
- Wizard with steps
- Inline help text
- Video tutorials
- Live chat support
- Pre-filled templates
- Show examples
- Progressive disclosure (show fields as needed)
- Voice input
- AI assistant
- Copy from competitor
- Mobile app with camera
- Gamification (points for completion)
- ... (50+ more)

## SCAMPER

**Purpose:** Apply seven creative lenses to existing solutions to generate variations

**When to use:**
- Improving existing solution
- Need structured creativity
- Stuck in obvious ideas
- Solo ideation

**Seven Lenses:**

### S - Substitute
**What can we replace?**
- Materials, components, people, processes
- "What if we used X instead of Y?"

Examples:
- Replace text form → voice input
- Replace manual entry → import from spreadsheet
- Replace tooltips → video tutorials

### C - Combine
**What can we merge?**
- Features, steps, tools, ideas
- "What if we combined X and Y?"

Examples:
- Combine product creation + inventory setup
- Combine form + preview
- Combine help docs + form fields

### A - Adapt
**What can we borrow from elsewhere?**
- Other industries, nature, history
- "What does X do that we could adapt?"

Examples:
- Adapt TurboTax interview style
- Adapt Instagram's photo filters
- Adapt video game tutorials

### M - Modify/Magnify/Minify
**What can we change, enlarge, or reduce?**
- Size, shape, frequency, intensity
- "What if we made X bigger/smaller/different?"

Examples:
- Magnify: Show huge preview
- Minify: Reduce to 3 required fields
- Modify: Change form to conversation

### P - Put to other uses
**What else could this be used for?**
- New contexts, users, purposes
- "What if X was used for Y?"

Examples:
- Product form → inventory import tool
- Preview → marketing material generator
- Templates → learning resource

### E - Eliminate
**What can we remove?**
- Features, steps, complexity
- "What if we removed X?"

Examples:
- Eliminate optional fields
- Eliminate separate steps
- Eliminate technical terms

### R - Reverse/Rearrange
**What if we flipped or reordered?**
- Sequence, roles, perspective
- "What if we did X backwards?"

Examples:
- Reverse: Start with preview, work backwards
- Rearrange: Put images first, details later
- Reverse: Let AI generate, user edits

**How to use:**

1. **Start with existing solution:**
   - Current product form

2. **Apply each lens:**
   - Go through S-C-A-M-P-E-R
   - Generate 3-5 ideas per lens
   - Don't judge, just generate

3. **Review ideas:**
   - Which are interesting?
   - Which could work?
   - Which to prototype?

**Example Session:**

Current: "15-field product creation form"

**Substitute:**
- Voice input instead of typing
- AI generates description from photo
- Import from competitor

**Combine:**
- Form + preview side-by-side
- Creation + inventory in one flow
- Help + form fields inline

**Adapt:**
- TurboTax interview style
- Instagram's simple photo upload
- Notion's slash commands

**Modify:**
- Reduce to 3 required fields
- Expand preview to full page
- Change to conversational UI

**Put to other uses:**
- Form becomes product catalog
- Preview becomes marketing page
- Template becomes tutorial

**Eliminate:**
- Remove all optional fields
- Remove separate steps
- Remove save button (auto-save)

**Reverse:**
- Start with preview, fill backwards
- AI generates, user edits
- Show examples first, form second

## Crazy 8s

**Purpose:** Force rapid idea generation through time constraint

**When to use:**
- Need to break past obvious ideas
- Individual ideation
- Quick exploration
- Before detailed brainstorming

**How to do it:**

1. **Prepare:**
   - Fold paper into 8 sections
   - Set timer for 8 minutes
   - Have HMW question ready

2. **Sketch:**
   - 1 minute per section
   - Sketch solution idea
   - Don't overthink
   - Quantity over quality

3. **Review:**
   - Which ideas are interesting?
   - Which to explore further?
   - Share with team

**Tips:**
- First 3 ideas will be obvious (that's OK)
- Ideas 4-6 get more interesting
- Ideas 7-8 are often breakthrough
- Don't worry about drawing skills
- Use stick figures and boxes

**Example:**

HMW: "How might we guide merchants through product creation?"

8 sketches (1 min each):
1. Step-by-step wizard
2. Inline help tooltips
3. Video tutorial overlay
4. AI chatbot assistant
5. Voice-guided creation
6. Copy from example
7. AR camera scan product
8. Collaborative creation (invite expert)

## Provotype Sketching

**Purpose:** Create deliberately extreme or provocative prototypes to spark breakthrough thinking

**When to use:**
- Stuck in incremental ideas
- Need to challenge assumptions
- Want to push boundaries
- Before converging on solution

**How to create:**

1. **Make it extreme:**
   - What's the most radical version?
   - What if we had unlimited resources?
   - What if we ignored all constraints?

2. **Make it provocative:**
   - What would shock users?
   - What would competitors never do?
   - What breaks all rules?

3. **Extract insights:**
   - What's interesting about this?
   - What could actually work?
   - What assumptions does it challenge?

**Examples:**

Problem: "Product creation form is too complex"

**Provotypes:**

1. **Zero-Field Form:**
   - No form at all
   - Just upload photo
   - AI generates everything
   - *Insight:* Could we reduce to 1-2 fields?

2. **100-Field Form:**
   - Every possible detail
   - Takes 2 hours to complete
   - Professional-grade
   - *Insight:* Different users need different depth

3. **Voice-Only:**
   - No typing allowed
   - Speak to create product
   - AI interprets
   - *Insight:* Could voice be an option?

4. **Collaborative:**
   - Can't create alone
   - Must invite expert
   - Expert fills technical fields
   - *Insight:* Could we offer expert help?

5. **Gamified:**
   - Product creation is a game
   - Earn points for fields
   - Unlock features
   - *Insight:* Could we make it fun?

**From Provotype to Real Solution:**

Provotype: "Zero-field form - just upload photo"

Real Solution: "Smart form that pre-fills from photo, user confirms/edits"

## Analogous Inspiration

**Purpose:** Find inspiration from completely different domains

**When to use:**
- Stuck in industry thinking
- Need fresh perspective
- Looking for innovation
- Breaking assumptions

**How to use:**

1. **Identify the challenge:**
   - What's the core problem?
   - Abstract it from your domain

2. **Find analogies:**
   - How does nature solve this?
   - How do other industries handle it?
   - What's a similar problem elsewhere?

3. **Extract principles:**
   - What's the underlying principle?
   - How does it work?
   - What can we borrow?

4. **Adapt to your context:**
   - How could this work here?
   - What would we need to change?
   - What's the adapted solution?

**Examples:**

**Problem:** "Merchants abandon complex product form"

**Analogies:**

1. **Nature: How do ants navigate?**
   - Ants leave pheromone trails
   - Others follow successful paths
   - *Principle:* Show the path others took
   - *Adaptation:* Show "most merchants fill these 5 fields first"

2. **Video Games: How do games teach?**
   - Tutorial levels
   - Gradual complexity
   - Immediate feedback
   - *Principle:* Progressive disclosure
   - *Adaptation:* Start with 3 fields, unlock more

3. **Restaurants: How do menus work?**
   - Specials highlighted
   - Descriptions for complex items
   - Pictures for popular items
   - *Principle:* Guide choices with visuals
   - *Adaptation:* Show examples of good products

4. **GPS Navigation: How does it guide?**
   - Shows current position
   - Shows destination
   - Shows next step
   - Recalculates if you deviate
   - *Principle:* Show progress and next step
   - *Adaptation:* Progress bar + "Next: add photo"

**Domains to explore:**
- Nature (biomimicry)
